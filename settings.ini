# This changes how the window looks at startup and gets dynamically updated as you use the client.
# The options are:
# windowed   - Starts the client in Windowed mode.
# maximized  - Starts with the window maximized.
# fullscreen - Starts the client in fullscreen mode. Press F11 to go to Window mode.
