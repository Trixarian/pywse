PyWSE v0.5
==========

PyWSE is a Container program for the WebStory Engine (http://webstoryengine.org) with the intent of creating a way for users to have a working local copy they can distribute in a file form. It currently only works on Linux with the Requirements installed, but there are plans to make this program stand-alone and multi-platform.

![PyWSE Example](http://brenton.nom.za/demo.jpg)

Requirements:
* Python 2.2+  
  - pygtk  
  - pywebkitgtk 
* GTK 2  
* libwebkit
  - gst-plugins-base


How do I use it?
----------------
Double click pywse to have a look at the demo.

For use with your own game:  
1. Place all the game related files (assets and webstory engine) in a directory called game. You can name the directory something other than game, but you'll have to change Directory in settings.ini to reflect this.  
2. Rename the pywse file to something else. I recommend the name of your game. ;)  
3. Modify settings.ini to suit your needs, write a simple README file and delete the LICENSE file if you want.  
4. Distribute!
